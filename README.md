I'm an AI architect, full-stack developer, and ex-Jack-of-All-Trades, with a deep interest in generative AI and building the future. 
I used to release music, for a time ran my own indie label, studied history before that, and for a time moonlighted in aerospace engineering in high school. 

I roll like Newton's first, witness my inertia.

- Full-stack development
